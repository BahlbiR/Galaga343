# GalagaRemix

Developed by Namco, Galaga was a popular arcade game in the 1980's that involved a spaceship, controlled by the player, that defended itself against a hoarde of enemy spaceships
firing projectiles at the player. This project was heavily inspired by galaga and is implemented using Python and the game development library, Pygame.
